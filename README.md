# Pomodoro App
This project uses the tkinter Python module to create a pomodoro timer app. The timer will run for 25 minutes, after which a 5-minute timer for a break will start. The user can reset the timer at any time. A screenshot of the UI can be seen below. The main.py file contains all code necessary to run this app, and the associated tomato image file is included in this repository. The exact image file location string may need to be changed based on where you decided to save the file. If it is in the same folder as the main.py file, the string will not need to be changed. However, if the image file is saved to a different folder, the string will need to be updated.
